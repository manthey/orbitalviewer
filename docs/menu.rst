File
====

New
---

Opens a new window containing the default orbital.  Generation of the orbital begins immediately.

Open
----

Opens an existing file in a new window.  Files in both .ORB and .OV file formats can be loaded.

* .ORB format contains the minimum necessary information to generate an orbital.
* .OV format contains all the results generated by Orbital Viewer, which allows processing to resume from exactly when the file was saved.

Save
----

Saves the current orbital.  If the orbital has previously been saved or was loaded from an existing file, the file is overwritten in the same format.  If the orbital has not been saved before, a dialog requests a file name and format.

Available save formats:

* .ORB - Orbital Specification Files - save the minimum information necessary for Orbital Viewer to create the orbital.

* .OV - Orbital Viewer Files - save the orbital and all of the work, including polygons, points, and raytracing, which has been done.

* .PPM - Portable Pixel Map Files - save a 24-bit per pixel uncompressed graphic.  This is a format popular on Unix machines.

* .TIF - Tagged Image File Format - save a 24-bit per pixel run-length-encoded compressed graphic.  This is a very wide spread format that can be read on almost any platform.

* .BMP - Windows Bitmap Files - save a 24-bit per pixel uncompressed graphic.  This is compatible with most Windows programs.

* .WRL - VRML Files - save a Virtual Reality Markup Language file.  This contains the polygon or point geometry, not the screen picture.  It is compatible with most VRML programs and with SGI Inventor.

* .TXT - Digistar Files - save a partial file that can be added to an existing header and used on a Digistar projector.  This contains the point or polygon geometry.  If both exist, only the points are saved.

Save As
-------

Saves the current orbital to a new file.  A dialog requests a file name and format.

See `Save`_ for available formats.

Close
-----

Closes the current window.

Preferences
-----------

Shows the Preferences Dialog, allowing various program-wide settings to be modified, including whether to show the start screen, how large points are, and how VRML files are saved.

Colors
------

Shows the Colors Dialog, allowing the colors used for the positive phase, negative phase, asymptote, background, and lighting and cutaway previews to be changed.

Customize Toolbar
-----------------

Shows a standard Windows dialog which allows the items on the toolbar to be changed.  A tool button is available for every menu item.

Link Extensions
---------------

This changes the Windows registry so that when a .ORB or .OV file is double clicked in the Explorer or File Manager, Orbital Viewer is automatically run.  Orbital Viewer must be run with Administrator permissions for this to work.

Exit
----

Quit Orbital Viewer.

Edit
====

Copy
----

Copies the current window to the clipboard.  This is copies as a 24-bit per pixel bitmap.  The size of the picture will be the same as the window unless the camera is set to a fixed size (see the Camera Dialog), in which case it will be the specified size.

Display
=======

Render Options
--------------

Shows the Render Options Dialog, which specifies what type of display to use.  This also turns on and off the quick rendering option where a different display type is used while rotating or otherwise manipulating an orbital.

Point Options
-------------

Displays the Point Options Dialog, where the number of points in a point probability display can be specified.

Polygon Options
---------------

Displays the Polygon Options Dialog, where the polygon density, refinement, opacity, and style (wireframe, solid, or points) can be set.  The density and refinement determine the number of polygons generated.

Raytrace Options
----------------

Displays the Raytrace Options Dialog, where the opacity, index of refraction, antialiasing mode, and other parameters can be set.

Asymptote Options
-----------------

Displays the Asymptote Options Dialog, where the asymptote density, opacity, and style (wireframe, solid, or points) can be set.  The density determines the number of polygons generated.

Orbitals
--------

Shows the Orbital Dialog, allowing the exact atom or molecule to be specified.

Lighting
--------

Displays the Lighting Dialog, which allows light sources to added, removed, or edited.

Stereo
------

Displays the Stereo Dialog, where the stereo display mode can be selected.  This allows a source image to be specified for stereograms, and allows the interocular distance to be set.

Camera
------

Displays the Camera Dialog, where the camera's position and orientation can be set.  This also allows a fixed image size to be specified, which applies to all saved and copied images.

Cutaway
-------

Displays the Cutaway Dialog, where a cutaway's type (plane, corner, or wedge), position, orientation, and properties can be specified.

Play Sequence
-------------

Displays the Play Sequence Dialog, where a sequence can be specified and started.  A sequence is a series where an orbital is transformed from one state to another (for example, rotation or probability surface), and optionally saved as a series of image files.

Stop Sequence
-------------

Stop a sequence from playing.  This does not stop the generation of the current orbital, but the sequence will not advance to the next frame when the current orbital is complete.

Compress AVI
------------

Requests an input AVI file, and an output file name.  The standard Windows AVI options dialog is then displayed, and the input file is copied to the output file using the selected compression technique.

This function is useful after creating an uncompressed AVI file using the Play Sequence option.  AVI files compress better if all frames are present.

Various DLLs are required to use the Compress AVI option, including AVIFIL32.DLL.

Move
----

Shift the orbital in the direction indicated.  The Preferences Dialog specifies the size of the shift relative to the size of the screen.

Rotate
------

Rotate the orbital in the direction indicated.  The Preferences Dialog specifies the size of the rotation.

Zoom
----

Change the camera location to zoom in or out on the orbital, or change the perspective factor to give a greater or less fish-eye lens effect.

Reset Position
--------------

Rotate the orbital so that the coordinate system is orthogonal to the screen, with positive *x* to the right, positive *y* pointing upward, and positive *z* pointing out of the screen.  The orbital is also scaled such that it fits entirely on the screen.

Reframe Orbital
---------------

Change the scale of the image such that the entire orbital would neatly fill the screen if it was at the reset position.  Note that if zoom has been used, the orbital may still appear very small or very large.

Set Default
-----------

Save the current orbital to the file DEFAULT.ORB located in the same directory as OV.EXE.  This file is used each time a new window is created.  This default can be eliminated by either deleting the file or by using the reset control in the Preferences Dialog.

Window
======

Cascade
-------

Arranges all non-minimized windows in an overlapped manner with each window the same size.

Tile Windows
------------

Arrange all non-minimized windows such that each one is completely visible and the main program window is filled.

Arrange Icons
-------------

Arranges all minimized windows title bars or icons in neat rows.

====

Help
----

Opens a web browser with a link for help.

About
-----

Displays copyright information, program version number, and the date of the last program compile.
